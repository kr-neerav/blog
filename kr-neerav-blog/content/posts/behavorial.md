## Disagree and Commit
Customer Problem: Partnering with a principal to define a data strategy for the org to reduce risk of exposure to sensitive employee data and improve data consumer experience.
Situation: I was representing the data engineering and analytics community in the working group. The principal proposed a secure data vending strategy that i disagreed with. In my opinion it significantly impacted customer experience without providing then benefits. Also data governance is a cost to an organization and its a spectrum so there are alternate points for us to be at.
Action: Created a 1 pager to compare secure data vending with an alternate approach. Compared the 2 approaches on multiple dimensions like customer experience, cost, access management. They still did not agree. I requested them to review this with other DE teams and customers to get their inputs.
Results: When drafting the strategy they kept the proposed secure data vending. When it went for review with DE teams and customers there was more questions/pushback on the secure data vending and we revised this. For analytics we replaced secure data vending with some of the options I had proposed. For application data exchange we continued with secure data vending.
Do Differently: Involved the privacy specialist so they could vet my position on the spectrum of data governance and other points we could be on. Offline i could have connected with a few data engineers, collected feedback and shared with PE so we could incorporate this feedback early.

### Tough or critical feedback you received
Customer Problem: We had multiple instances of silent data quality issues in our datasets and customers had escalated. We wanted to improve our detection of such issues and prevent it from being published.
Situation: There were 2 sister teams and we had built a basic version of data quality monitoring using AWS deequ that helped us with data quality monitoring. The sister team was also trying to solve a similar problem. My manager asked me to see if they can leverage our solution. I took it as a challenge to influence them to use ours. I setup a meeting with them and focused on selling our solution to them. On all the approach they were exploring I will counter that will this can be done in our solution. After some time they went quiet. Later on my manager provided feedback that this was not the right way to work with other teams. we need to understand their situation, acknowledge their work and then try to see if we can identify value add for them to use our solution.
Action: Setup a meeting with them again and first acknowledged that my approach in last meeting to sell our soultion was not right. I want to first understand the current state and together we can come up with a solution that helps us address the problem. I listed to them, acknowledged their approach, explored possibilities and proposed value add on how they can save some of the time by using existing capabiltiy we had and proposed to improve our solution by them contributing to enhance it for their use cases.
Result: We jointly enhanced our data quality monitoring solution, used it for 30+ datasets that we own and 20+ datasets that they owned.

### Not able to meet a commitment
Customer Problem: We had a security incident where one of our customers had used sensitive employee data for a use case they were not approved for. It was escalated by a VP. When we did a deep dive we found they were granted access a few years back and never baselined. We never did baseline for access to our data and the same was true for multiple teams in our org.
Situation: Leaders in our org asked us to drive an initiative to baseline access across all data products in the org. There were about 340 datasets and 160 dashboards. We provided an estimate of 3 weeks, 1 week to prep and 2 week to execute. When we created a detailed plan we realized its going to take us more time to prepare and we proposed a timeline of 5 weeks. When we actually went about executing the baseline it took us about 12 weeks to complete. Some of the challenges were delays from customer end to recertify their access, conflicting priorities on teams in our org, lack of preparedness by the teams in our org to execute it.
Actions: We kept sending out weekly flash to leaders so they were aware of the process, challenges and what we were doing to address them. Among other teams in the org we were the biggest vendors of data. So we shared best practices we followed and learnings with other teams.
Result: Successful completion of the access baseline. We documented practices, learnings to stremline this process moving forward. This was also an input to the org wide data strategy on what platforms should be leveraged so we can automate the baseline.

### Uncovered a significant problem in the team/ improved team's productivity
Customer problem: We were puting out 20% to 45% of hte tasks in our sprints and didn't have a good understanding why. There were multiple occurence of missing timelines committed to customers. We always had some specific reasons but i believed we were not planning/executing the tasks appropriatly. 
Situation:
Actions: I analyzed past 8 sprints and realized we were punting 20% to 45% of the tasks. Our sprint retro was too generic with team discussing unrelated challenges. Even our standup process was not helping us understand if we are on track on the sprint tasks or delayed. I collected all this data and created a 2 pager proposal. It analytized our current state and identified the root cause as team working on stories before they are groomed and also team not doing an effective sprint retro to learn from past experience and prevent it. I proposed a new agenda for sprint retro that included specific section where each person analyzes what they are punting, why and what they can do to prevent it in future. I also proposed a definition of done for grooming so team can focus on execution of the task when its included in sprint instead of clarifying requirements.
Result: After following this process for a quarter, we observed number of punted tasks falling below 10%, we had specific learnings and understanding of why we are punting tasks. In the subsequent voice of customer meeting we received anecdotal evidence from customers on an improvement on our team meeting timelines.

### Helped a team member who was struggling or impacted my work
Customer Problem: our team was working on a proposal to improve the data quality of our datasets, which we can later use to improve data quality for other teams in the org.
Situation: An engineer was assigned this project and they were working with their manager on this. When we reviewed the initial proposal it focussed too much of the tooling but not enough on the root cause for the current state of data quality in the org. I asked them to meet with all teams in our org and revise the proposal. In the next revision of the proposal it still focused on tooling instead of the root cause.
Action: I explained to them before we propose any tooling we should be able to describe in 1 page what is the root cause of lack of data quality monitoring in the org and if tooling is the gap we should provide evidence for that. I reviewed the interview notes from other teams and they were focused on discussion about what capabilities teams want for data quality monitoring. I setup meeting with 2 of the teams again and led the discussion so they could understand what kind of information we collect to diagnose the current situation.
Result: They were able to collect meaningful insights from the rest of the teams. Together we identified lack of data quality monitoring in the org was due to lack of understanding of what should one monitor as part of data quality. We created the proposal that defines what kind of data quality issues are, what are the different sources to understand what is critical to monitor, what are the different approaches to monitor for such issues. In the end we leveraged existing tooling instead of building our own. We completed monitoring on 35 datasets owned by us and reviewed this proposal with other teams in the org showing evidence of this strategy being successful. Currently have helped 1 more team in the org to improve their data quality  monitoring. We are still working with other teams to improve their data quality monitoring.
Do differently: Customer interviews I should have been part of hte first round of intervies so we did not have to go through them again. At the beginning of the initiative set the expectations and been more explicit on how they should draft the proposal, template they should use.
