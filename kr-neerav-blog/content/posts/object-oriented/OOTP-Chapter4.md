* class name should be descriptive. in Java class name needs to be the same as file name else it won't compile.
* write description of class in comments before starting of the class
* objects used as attributes are reference to the objects that are created in heap.
* class attributes are private but might need to be accessed by other objects or for debugging. Accessor methods (getter and setter) are created for it. these methods also help with security by not sharing details like password and data integrity by validing input before setting the class attribute value.
* the private methods are meant to be part of implementation and not public interface.
