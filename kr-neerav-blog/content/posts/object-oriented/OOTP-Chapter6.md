## Design guidelines
* the system or object model is made of up class diagrams and class interactions. this model should represent the system faithfully. this model is created in the tool called unified modelling language (UML)
* in the analysis phase users and developers must do research and analysis to determine the requirements and whether to actually do the project. This will minimize rework cost later and ensure we are building a product that solves user problem.
* a statement of work is a document that describes the system. anyone reading this document should be able to get a complete and high level understanding of the system. This is different from requirements which are focussed on technical and functional requirements. SOW is written in narrative form.
* requirements describe what the users want the system to do. they are more specific and often written as bullet points.
* after requirements classes are identified. a simple way of identifying classes is to highlight all nouns in the requirements. its not important to get all classes right upfront. You might add, eliminate or change classes afterwards.
* next you need to identify responsibilities of each class which includes data it needs to store and operations the class can perform.
* determine how classes will interact with each other
* prototyping the user inteface in code during design phase. we can either sketch the user interface by drawing it on paper or whiteboard, use a prototyping tool like visual basic or develop it in IDE. At this point there is no businesss logic and these are basically facades.
