## Array
* Input characterists like datatype, size of array, sorted/unsorted, duplicates
* constraints on values in array e.g. all positive or only english characters
* Edge cases
    * empty array
    * null input
    * invalid input
    * large input
* time complexity requirements
* space complexity requirements. can i modify array inplace
## Linked list
* similar to above
* is it singly, double linked list
* edge case apart from above
    * can the linked list have cycles
## String
* which character set unicode, ascii or english characters or digits
* are comparisons case sensitive
* whitespace characters leading/trailing. how should they be handled
* special characters like escape, newline and how they should be handled
* edge cases same as above
## Tree
* type of tree binary, n-way tree, BST
* node structure, does it have pointer to children, parent, both
* is the tree balanced
* if BST then are duplicates allowed. if yes are they left or right node
* can i modify the tree or return a new tree
* edge cases
    * empty tree
    * single node tree
    * large tree

## Test Cases
### Array
* Basic array of 3-5 elements
* edge cases
    * empty array
    * single element array
    * array with duplicates
    * array with all elements are same
* sorted array ascending/descending
* partially/unsorted array
* boundary conditions
    * if there are range of values test at and near boundary conditions
### Linked list
* Basic linked list 3-5 elements
* edge cases
    * empty list
    * single node
    * list with some duplicates
    * list with all same values
* boundary conditions
    * head of the list
    * tail of the list
    * middle of the list
* structure
    * linear list
    * circular list
    * list with a cycle
* insert/delete at beginning, middle and end of the list
### String
* empty string
* short string
* string with min/max length
* pattern found at beginning/middle/end, pattern not found, pattern with special character, empty pattern
* string with repeated characters/all same characters
*
