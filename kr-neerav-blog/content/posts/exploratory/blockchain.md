## Notes
### Blockchain Introduction
### Chapter 1: Blockchain 1.0: Currency
* The technology stack consists of Blockchain (underlying decentralized ledger), Protocal and Client (the software system that transfers money over the decentralized ledger) and currency (the layer that users use in real world).
* Double spend problem: Since digital assests are easy to reproduce/copy there was no way to confirm if digital cash had not already been spent. There were trusted third partiers like bank, paypal that maintained ledgers confirming that each portion of digital cash was spent only once. The blockchain solves it by maintaing a coin ownership in a public ledger and confirmed by cryptographic protocols and the mining community. 
* Byzantine General's problem: It is the challenge involved in achieving concensus among multiple parties where some nodes may be faulty or malicious. There is no central authority that can drive this concensus and the partiers have to rely on communication among themselves. The block chain solves this as there is no central authority and the nodes don't trust each other but trust the software protocol that runs the system. There are algorithms that are used to come to concensus.
* How Cryptocurreny works: There is an address (where others can send you money), private key (you can send money using this) and the wallet (software to manage your currency locally). 
* Personal Cryptosecurity: Being a decentralized system there is no customer service to call if you lose the private key stored in your wallet. There are services coming up to backup the wallet online in case users local smartphone, laptop breaks down. Each crypto currency has their own wallet. As more crypto currency there is a need for a unified wallet to hold all currencies.
* Benefits: Cryptocurrency uses push technology i.e. user pushes relevant information to the network for the transaction. The current transactions use pull based technology (credit card/bank) in which the user information on file need to be pulled during the transaction. Pull technologies require centralized data stores for customer data which increases vulnerability of hacker identity theft. There is also the benefit of lower trnsaction fee compared to the current credit card processing fee. The funds are received in digital wallets immediately compared to the current system of waiting for days. 
* Challenges: apart from the ones called out in Personal Cryptosecurity, merchants face challenges with maintaining 2 separate systems (traditional and cryptocurrency) for payments. This needs to be integrated into one. 
### Chapter 2: Blockchain 2.0: Contracts
* Blockchain 2.0 is decentralized markets more generally and allows transfer of many other kinds of assets beyond currency.
* The key idea is that the decentralized ledger could be used to register, confirm and transfer all manner of contacts and property.
* Physical assests can be encoded as digital assests on the blockchain for controlled access to homes, hotel rooms, rental.
* Paypal is a good example of something that was equivalent to Bitcoin at the time of launch e.g. initially it was a payment solution outside of traditional financial services market.
* It is used for lending, crowdfunding.
* Blockchain encoded property becomes smart property that is available for transactable via smart contracts. Any assest registered on blockchain and its ownership controlled by whoever has the private key. The owner can sell the assest by transferring the private key.
