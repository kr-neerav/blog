### Rule 1: Don't Follow Your Passion
* Follow what Steve Jobs does, not what he says.
* Roadtrip Nation: A documentary on interviewing people who lived lives centered around what is meaningful to them.
* Compelling careers have complex origins that reject the simple idea of following your passion.
* Passion takes time. People who are passtionate in their job usually have spent a lot of years on the job. Mastery happens in phases. The key is to force yourself through work, force the skills to come, that is the hardest part.
* As per science there are 3 things motivate people at work.
    * Autonomy: feeling that you have control over your day and your actions are important
    * Competence: feeling that you are good at what you do
    * Relatedness: feeling of connection to other people
### Rule 2: So good they can't ignore you
* this rules helps you focus on you instead of the work/others, which matters most in career.
* Eventually you are so experiened that there is a confidence that comes out and the audience can smell it.
* this reflects the mindset "what you can offer to the world"
* entry level jobs are not going to be filled with challenging projects and autonomy, these come later.
* no one owns you a great career - you need to earn it - and the process won't be easy
* adopting a craftsman mindset will build the foundation on which you can build a rewarding career.
* you adopt craftsman mindset first and then passion follows
* the traits that define great work are rare and valuable. By economic theory of supply and demand to get the job you must offer something valueable in return. This valuable things are the skills you develop a.k.a career capital. The craftsman mindset of becoming so good that they can't ignore you is well suited to developer career capital.
* good job has 3 traits 1) creativity: lets you be creative 2) impact: lets you have a big impact 3) control: lets you be in control of work, timing, life.
