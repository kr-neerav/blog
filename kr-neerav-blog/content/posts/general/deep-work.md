## Chapter Notes
These notes are what I found useful when reading the book. This is not a summary of the book.
### Chapter 1: Deep work is valuable
* In the new economy (knowledge workers) highly skilled wokers and superstars will thrive. Highly skilled workers as they help understand complex ideas and put it into use. Superstars as in a networked world where collaboration can be done from anywhere, the talent pool has increased and thus has the comptetition. Its no longer local the area. 
* The abilities that will be required for the new economy are to quickly master hard things and produce content at elite level both in speed and quality. Both of these abilities require deep work.
* To master hard things one needs deliberate practice. It is the ability to focus the attention on a skill/idea you are trying to master and consistent feedback to be able to focus on what is most productive. When attention is focussed new neural patterns are developed. In a distracted experience random neurons are firing which prevents the neural patterns from developing and becoming stronger. 
* Deep work helps produce content at elite level. Output = Time spent x Intensity of Focus. Hence more output or higher quality output is possible in the same amount of time if Intensity of Focus is high. This also means one does not need to work longer to create value. The way brain works in context switches is that some residue is left from the previous tasks during the switch. The residue is higher if the previous task was incomplete. Distractions during focussed time like email, chat carries over residue when switching back to focused task. This residue is higher as one does not respond to email/chat in that moment.
* Executives have less need of focussed time. Over years they have gained experience of making decisions efficiently. They are better off hiring other to do the deep work and bring to them the proposal/options for them to decide. However strategic thinking by executives/managers still requires deep thinking. 
### Chapter 2: Deep work is rare
* Its hard to measure impact of distractions on the bottom line. This is a common reason distractions are not challenged in the workplace. 
* It easy to respond to distractions. Otherwise one needs to plan the day, tasks, decide on what to do. Just responding to distractions is far easier. Additionally it makes one look busy (but might not be productive). Richard Feyman example. They wanted focussed time to do physics so when anyone asked them for administrative they came up with the excuse that they are irresponsible.
* The internet is reducing our options not by making those illegal, immoral or unpopular but by making them invisible. Thus a common push it to be visible in social media. However this is contradictory to deep work. 
### Chapter 3: Deep work is meaningful
* Deep work is very satisfying to complete (agree based on personal experience)
* Neurological: Deep work requires us to focus on the goal. This reduces the amount of time we have to focus on other unhappy or non use ful things. This makes sure our day is more satisfying. Also usually shallow work is not very helupful or positive or impactful.
* Psychological: The study conducted revealed that jobs are easier to enjoy than free time because jobs have goals, feedback and challenges which encourage one to be involved in one's work i.e. to concentrate and lose oneself. Free time is unstructured and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. 
* Good story: When conducting psychological study in 1980s there were challenges doing it in lab or in field. In lab if people are asked to recall how they felt on specific times during the day they will be unable to do so. If they are given a diary to fill throughout the day on how they were feeling it was too daunting a task and they won't be able to do it. The solution proposed by 2 psychologists was a pager which will page some times during the day and participants have to record what they are doing and feeling in the moment. Since this is a few times a day people are able to do.
### Chapter 4: Work Deeply
* Why do we need to create rituals to do focussed work? People fight desrires all day long. Desire turned out to be norm instead of exception. Desire distracts from deep work. Also you have finite amount of will power and it depletes as you use it. Thus can't use willpower to do deep work against distractions. By setting rituals (time/place) for deep work we minimize the amount of willpower needed to shift to deep work. 
* There are different types of deep work. The one that is useful for my field of work is Deep Work Scheduling. Within each day allocating blocks out time (preferably 90 minutes) for deep work. The rest of the day is for other responsibilities. One can track the work by using chain method (mark each day with cross when you did your planned amount of deep work). Also eliminating scheduling decisions  can reduce the barrier to move into deep work. By getting little done regularly, one will log a lot of deep work hours during the year. 
* Ritual: Where will you work and for how long? How you will work (e.g. no internet or phone)? How you will support your work (e.g. snacks, water and organize raw materials support required by brain).
* Don't Work Alone: Include time for interaction, collaboration with others. Balance both collaboration and deep work (hub and spoke model)
* Execute Like a Business: Lessons from the book "The 4 Diciplines of Execution".
    * Focus on Widly Important: Small number of very important goals
    * Act on Lead Measures: Goal might be a lag measure (output metric), come up with a lead measure (input metric). The lead measure can provide insights early on the progress.
    * Keep a compelling scorecard: Helps measure the performance on lead measures.
    * Create a cadence for accountability: Just like business has teams meet reguarly on status and to review progress. Do the same for your individual work. Weekly retro for learnings and celebration.
* Downtime is good: If you need to do a math calculation only your concious mind is able to do it. But if you need to take decisions involving large amount of information and multiple vague or conflicting contraints the unconcious mind is suited for it. This is because the unconcious mind has more neurons thus more bandwidth for flow of information and to explore more possibilities. 
* Downtime in nature is good to recharge. In busy areas mind is busy navigating/getting distracted. In Nature less distractions and its calmer. 
* How to shut down from work? After work one should not do any work related activity e.g. checking email, thinking about past conversations or future conversations. The way to implement this ritual is at the end of the day clear your inbox, identify any pending tasks, review the calendar for upcoming days (to ensure nothing important fall through) and create a plan for next day. Once this is done say out loud "Shutdown complete". Over time this ritual can help not think about work outside of office. Even if it requires staying a few minutes extra at office, do this. 
* Donald Knuth quote "I try to learn certain areas of computer science exhaustively; then i try to digest that knowledge into a form that is accessible to people who don't have time for such study".
### Chapter 5:Embrace Boredom
* Insted of scheduling break from distraction to focus try the other way round which is break from focus to ocasional distraction.
* Schedule blocks that are free from internet use, even when you are blocked. Try to resist the urge to check internet immediately when need arises. A delay of 5 minutes will not cause too much delay but will ensure you address the urge to immediately check internet.
* Allocate time in the day when you are physically busy but not mentally e.g. walking, jogging, shower etc. During this time focus on a hard problem. This will give you practice of focussing your attention. When you try there will be distractions like mind will offer unrelated but seemingly more interesting thoughts. When that happens acknowledge and bring the mind back to focus on the hard problem. Another trick that mind does is looping through already known things. The mind does this to save energy and going deep requires energy and mind wants to save that energy. 
* Add structure to your thinking to make it more produtive e.g. thinking of main sections to write or high level concepts etc. 
* Pick up an activity that requires you to focus your attention. This is important as practicing deep focus. The activity could be your hobby. 
### Chapter 7: Drain the shallows
* Plan each minute of the day. Initially you are going to underestimate but over time you will begin to make accurate plan.
* If an activity finishes early then you can do any non urgent tasks. This allows you to account for unpredictability without changing the plan.
* Without structure it is easy to allow your time to devolve into shallows like social media, email, entertainment. This is satisfying in the moment but is not conducive to creativity.
* A deep work habit requires you to treat time with respect.
* Shallow work in isolation and in the moment seems important but when aggregated over time its impact becomes visible.
* People who do deep work progress more in their careers as they produce more value over time. In addition they do not need to stretch their work hours to do so.
* Its ok to become hard to reach by email/social media. People adjust their expectations accordingly. Its important to focus on producing value.
* Be more thoughtful rather than responsive in your response.
