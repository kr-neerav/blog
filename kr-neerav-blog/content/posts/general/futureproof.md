## Chapter Notes
### Rule 1: Be Surprising, Social and Scarce
* Surprising: AI is better than humans at working in stable environments. Humans are better than AI at handling surprises, filling gaps or operating in environments with poorly defined rules or incomplete information. Be good at handling the unexpected i.e who are cool in crisis, like dealing with messy problems and novel scenarios, can move forward in absence of concrete plan - still have an advantage.
* Social: AI is good at meeting the material needs, humans are good at meeting the social needs. People skilled at creating social and emotional experince(making people feel) will be better positioned for the future rather than people whose primary skill is making or doing things efficiently. The value of Emotional intelligence is now acknowledged in companies. When machine can do most of the basic, repetitive functions of our jobs as well or better than we can what's left for us will be emotional or social parts.
* Scarce: AI is better at doing a particular job really well and humans are good at work that combine unusual combinations of skills, high stakes situations. Humans spot a problem in one area of life and use information learned doing something different to fix it. Combining ideas from different domain has been the key for innovation. Also AI learns in iterative way i.e. repeats tasks over many times. In high stakes situation it might not be possible to learn through iteration and that is beter fit for humans. The final kind of scarce work is extraordinary talent. Humans will still require role models and want to be inspired by human greatness. Sports are a great way to demonstrate that but it is true for extraordinary talent in all fields. It inspire others. 
### Rule 2: Resist Machine Drift
* Recommendations started as a utility to read our mind (preferences) and sort through vast amount of data to find us what is relevant. Over time they also change our mind by only showing things that we prefer or based on algorithm hiding from us what could be relevant.
* Quote from Jeff Bezos "When you reduce friction, make something easy, people do more of it."
* Its ok to add some friction in life if it helps gets expore to new experience data. We don't always need to follow the frictionless path e.g. read newspaper instead of newsfeed.
### Rule 3: Demote your Devices
* Who is in charge? is it you or the device.
* People feel compelled to check their devices for update or respond to mails. for them the device is in charge. And device is just the medium its their habit that is the problem.
* When devices are used by a person when they have an intent of using it, then its good e.g. chat with another person, call or group chat. however when its just used as a medium to consume random/async information, its not a right value of the time.
* Devices also keep you busy when you are bored. Being bored and day dreaming helps with coming up with new ideas, combining ideas/concepts. If devices keep you busy you won't have time to come up with new ideas.
### Rule 4: Leave Handprints
* We cannot differentiate ourselves from robots with hard work. Machine can always work harder than us.
* Hustle culture is biased towards certain individuals who are young, childless, able-bodied who are less likely to have family responsibilities and more likely to be able to work long hours. It also does not create an equitable and humane work environment.
* The example comparing DVD player and a handmade ceramic bowl. Machines can create very sofisticated product but the one that requires human experience and will be valued in future. Leaving handprints on your work i.e which can show there is human effort involved here instead of it being produced by machine. Doing this now requires concious effort e.g. Facebook birthdays wishes are no longer valuable unless its personalized. One has to be creative on how to leave handprints in their work.
### Rule 5: Don't be an endpoint
* An endpoint is a person acting as a middle layer as machines don't have an integration yet. In this the majority of the work is owned and managed by machine and only a small gap that has not been automated if filled by humans.
* Instead focussing on machine assisted work where the work is managed by humans and machine assists it is important.
* People who have regularly in person interactions can produce more creative work and remote employees can be more productive since they save time, work along but might lack creativity. 
* Remote workers need to go overboard to express their humanity and remind others of their presence. Also create opportunities to interact socially via virtual calls, connect on non work related calls, be on video calls.
